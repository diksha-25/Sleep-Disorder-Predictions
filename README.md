# Sleep Disorder Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of sleep disorders based on various health and lifestyle factors. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze sleep patterns and identify potential disorders.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Machine learning model development and evaluation
- Model interpretability and visualization

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains patient sleep-related information, including:

- **Sleep Duration**
- **Snoring Frequency**
- **Daily Activity Levels**
- **Stress Levels**
- **Medical History**

## 💊 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost

## 🔥 Results

The models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC scores. The best model provides reliable predictions for identifying potential sleep disorders.

# 💤 Sleep Disorder Prediction 🧠

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict **Sleep Disorders** using a person’s lifestyle and medical data.  
We analyze features like **age, BMI, physical activity, stress, blood pressure, sleep duration** and more to determine whether an individual is prone to:
- 💤 **Insomnia**
- 😴 **Sleep Apnea**
- ✅ **No Sleep Disorder**

---

## 📊 Dataset Info  
The dataset contains:
- 400 records
- 13 insightful features including:
  - `Age, Gender, Occupation`
  - `BMI Category, Sleep Duration`
  - `Physical Activity, Stress Level`
  - `Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Daily Steps`
  - and `Sleep Disorder Status`  

📂 **Source:** Custom curated from Sleep Health and Lifestyle patterns.

## 🔬 Exploratory Data Analysis  

- Gender distribution shows a balanced dataset 👫  
- Occupations like **Nurse** and **Salesperson** were highly linked to sleep disorders.  
- Higher BMI often meant higher chances of sleep-related problems! 🧁⚠️

📈 Sample Plots:
- Age vs Sleep Disorder
- Gender vs Sleep Disorder
- BMI vs Sleep Disorder

## 🧑‍💻 Model Building  

We used two classification models:

| Model                   | Accuracy 🎯 | F1-Score 💡 |
|-------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier | 87%           | 0.83        |
| 🌲 Random Forest Classifier | 89%           | 0.86        |

The **Random Forest Classifier** outperformed, offering higher accuracy and better generalization.

## ⚡ Technologies Used  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas & NumPy 🔢  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📊  
- Scikit-Learn 🤖  

---

## 💡 Conclusion  
Gender, Occupation, and BMI have a significant impact on sleep disorders.  
The model suggests:
- **Females** are prone to **Sleep Apnea**
- **Males** lean toward **Insomnia**
- Occupations like **Nurses** and **Salespersons** face higher risks.

✅ Random Forest Classifier proved to be the best model for prediction!

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sleep-disorder-prediction.git
cd sleep-disorder-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
python sleep_disorder_analysis.py
```
